# NodeJS NAPI Types Importer
Author: **Cesaryuan**

A Binary Ninja plugin that imports NodeJS N-API Types.

## Description:

The embedded `Import Header File` seems can't handle the `NAPI` types because they are [/DELAYLOAD (Delay Load Import) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/delayload-delay-load-import?view=msvc-170).

So I wrote this plugin to import the `NAPI` types.
